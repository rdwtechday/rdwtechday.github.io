ING reorganized IT five times to increase agility and speed. After going agile / scrum for application development 6 years ago ING restructured the IT department in 180 agile DevOps teams. Then ING integrated the commercial colleagues in > 400 self-organizing squads (BizDevOps) inspired by Spotify’s organizational model. Two years ago ING radically changed the people approach for software engineers to enable and reward engineering mastery. Last year ING restructured the infrastructure department empowering the engineers more. The last step is to implement an engineer centric control framework and fine-tune deployment pipelines to remove IT Risk related manual work and wait times. ING is convinced that in order to go fast, engineers need to be in control. Full stack. Such changes require a lot of learning from everybody involved. 

*Take-aways:*
Agility at scale requires multiple paradigm shifts for every one involved. This talk addresses how ING got to where it is today, and how ING is struggling together (this is a good thing) to align with infra, security, IT risk and audit departments. Henk will talk about the principles that guide an agile control framework and how that translates into the design of an integrated infra – application continuous delivery pipeline. Main principles addressed are: Outcomes over impositions, Shift-left, Immutable Servers, Cattle and Pets.
